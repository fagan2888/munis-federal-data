# Federal Data Usage by City Governments

This summer The Sunlight Foundation launched, in collaboration with [Kate Rabinowitz](https://github.com/katerabinowitz), a  national survey of city staff about how federal data informs their work. 

[You can read about our findings here.](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2017/10/23/american-cities-depend-on-federal-data/) 

This repository includes: 
- [The Federal Data Usage by City Governments Survey](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/munis-federal-data/blob/master/FedUseCitySurvey.pdf)
- [Survey Results](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/munis-federal-data/blob/master/fedUseRawResults.csv)
- [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/munis-federal-data/blob/master/fedUseDataDictionary.csv)

Please note that the survey results shown here do not include the respondent's name or email address to protect their privacy. Similarly, the city name has been masked. 

We encourage you to play with and analyze the data yourself. Let us know what you find!
